
1.Show all patient records in the dataset.

2.Count the total number of patients.

3.Find the number of male and female patients.

4.List distinct chest pain types found in the dataset.

5.Find the average age of all patients.

6.Find the maximum, minimum, and average cholesterol level.

7.Find patients with fasting blood sugar greater than 120 mg/dl.

8.Show patients who have exercise-induced angina.

9.Count how many patients have heart disease (target=1) vs normal (target=0).

10.Find the average resting blood pressure for patients with and without heart disease.

11.Group patients by chest pain type and find the average cholesterol for each group.

12.Find the average maximum heart rate by gender.

13.Find how age affects heart disease: group patients by age ranges (e.g., 30â€“40, 41â€“50, etc.) and show average target value.

14.List top 10 patients with the highest cholesterol levels.

15.Find correlation trends: For example, check how many patients with high cholesterol (>240) also have heart disease.

16.Find the percentage of patients with exercise-induced angina who also have heart disease.

17.Use a subquery to find patients whose cholesterol is above the datasetâ€™s average cholesterol.

18.Find the most common combination of symptoms (e.g., chest pain type + fasting blood sugar + target).

19.Calculate the risk rate of heart disease for males vs females (percentage).

20.Find patients most at risk: those with high cholesterol (>240), high resting BP (>140), and heart disease (target=1).
