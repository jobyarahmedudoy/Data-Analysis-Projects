# Heart Disease Data Analysis using SQL
This project focuses on analyzing a Heart Disease dataset using SQL to uncover medical insights and identify factors that contribute to heart disease.
By applying SQL queries on patient data, the project extracts meaningful patterns, relationships, and trends among key health indicators.
## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following attributes (columns):

- `age`: Represents the age of the patient.
- `chest_pain_type`: Describes the type of chest pain experienced (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic).
- `sex`: Indicates gender (1 = male, 0 = female).
- `resting_bp_s`: Resting blood pressure of the patient in mm Hg.
- `cholesterol`: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl.
- `fasting_blood_sugar`: Indicates if fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false).
- `resting_ecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results.
- `max_heart_rate`: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
- `exercise_angina`: Exercise-induced angina indicator (1 = yes, 0 = no).
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- `st_slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- `target`: Output class (1 = patient has heart disease, 0 = normal).
